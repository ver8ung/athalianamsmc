# athalianamsmc
scripts for MSMC analysis of A.thaliana populations

currently WIP

features up until now:
- read input files from destination / store filenames
- run MSMC on .multihetsep.txt files
- fixed time segmenting pattern for single chromosome runs
- counts runs and appends a number to the output
- use -I as a variable with increasing counts for 2 hap (ToDo: 4 hap 6 hap 8 hap configuration)

ToDo:
-> for loop for values of -I
