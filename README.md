# athalianamsmc
scripts for MSMC analysis of A.thaliana effective population size history

currently WIP

features up until now:
- iterates over up to customizeable amount of haplotypes in the input (2,4,6,8 haplotypes)
- plots the results of a single run after it completes

ToDo:
- general strategy : one big script with this approach or multiple smaller ones that can be run together in a batch job file ?!
- implement cross coalescence runs
- refine the code
